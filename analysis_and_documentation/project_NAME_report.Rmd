### Brief description of dashboard topic

The objective of this project is the creation of a dashboard which can demonstrate the affect that the Winter season has on the acute health sector in Scotland.  

In order to realise this objective, a preliminary wire-frame of the end product was designed during the Initial Design Review (IDR) in `WP1.1 - Project Set-up`. More information on the design reviews is found in a later section.

The Minimum Value Product (MVP) of the dashboard, found in `WP 2.3 - Shiny App MVP`, can be separated into sidebar, with each tab displaying relevant information. 
* The main, or **General Stats** page, can be divided into three key sections:  
  * An about section  
  * A map displaying hospital locations and Health Board areas  
  * A graph displaying <hospital addmsion since 2016, and COVID-19 related admission>  
* The first page, or **A&E Activity** page, can be divided into three key sections:  
  * A heat map of where there is the most admissions  
  * A time series of a&e activity from *2020* to *2021* ??? 
  * A graph displaying <...>  
* The second page, or **Deprivation page** page, which was re-prioritised after the Detailed Design Review (DDR) from the `WP 2.3 - Shiny App MVP` to `WP2.2.4 - Features`, can be divided into three key sections:  
  * A heat map of where there is the most addmissions  
  * A time series of a&e activity from *2020* to *2021* ??? 
  * A graph displaying <...>    
* The third page, or **COVID-19** page, can be divided into three key sections:  
  * A heat map of where there is the most cases  
  * A time series of covid cases from *2020* to *2021* ??? 
  * A graph displaying <...>  


Additionally, `WP2.2.4 - Features` added the following aspects to the Shiny App:
1. checkboxes of each health board
2. drop down menu for individual hospitals in that health board
3. Tabs
  1). Map of Scotland
  2). Time series graphs
  3). proportional graphs
4. buttons such as:
  * reset
  * select all
* stats on deprivation
* custom palettes, colour blind friendly
* forecasting

The topic of our MVP is looking specifically at Accident and Emergency (A&E)

The dashboard outlines our topic in terms of ...
