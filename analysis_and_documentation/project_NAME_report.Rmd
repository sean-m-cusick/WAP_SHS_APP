### Brief description of dashboard topic

The objective of this project is the creation of a dashboard which can demonstrate the affect that the Winter season has on the acute health sector in Scotland.  

##### Initial Wire-Frame for MVP (IDR) 
In order to realise this objective, a preliminary wire-frame of the end product was designed during the Initial Design Review (IDR) in `WP1.1 - Project Set-up`. This wire-frame can be found in the annex.  

*** 

##### Revised Wire-Frame for MVP (DDR)
During the Detailed Design Review (DDR), the design was further streamlined, with superfluous features moved to the `WP2.2.4 - Features` work package. The updated wire-frame is displayed below:  

![wire-frame: version 2 general page](../analysis_and_documentation/image/v2_mvp_wireframe_general.png)  

![wire-frame: version 2 COVID page - Tab 1](../analysis_and_documentation/image/v2_mvp_wireframe_covid_tab1.png)  

![wire-frame: version 2 COVID page - Tab 2](../analysis_and_documentation/image/v2_mvp_wireframe_covid_tab2.png)  

![wire-frame: version 2 A&E page](../analysis_and_documentation/image/v2_mvp_wireframe_ae.png)



The Minimum Value Product (MVP) of the dashboard, found in work package `WP 2.3 - Shiny App MVP`, can be separated into a sidebar, with each tab displaying relevant information. 
* The main, or **General Statistics** page, can be divided into three key sections:  
  * An about section  
  * A map displaying hospital locations and Health Board areas  
  * A section displaying key statistics, e.g.  _<hospital admission since 2016, and COVID-19 related admission>_, with a drop-down menu to select Health Board  
* The first page, or **COVID-19** page, can be divided into Two tabs:  
  * The first tab displays three key sections:  
    * A summarisation of the results  
    * A fixed graph displaying ... 
    * A fixed graph displaying ... 
  * The second, optional tab that displays an interactive graph:  
* The second page, or **A&E Activity*** page, , can be divided into three key sections:  
  * A heat map of where there is the most admissions  
  * A time series of a&e activity from *2020* to *2021* ??? 
  * A graph displaying <...>    
* The third page which was re-prioritised after the Detailed Design Review (DDR) from the `WP 2.3 - Shiny App MVP` to `WP2.2.4 - Features`, *would have been* divided into three key sections:  
  * A heat map of where there is the most cases  
  * A time series of COVID cases from *2020* to *2021* ??? 
  * A graph displaying <...>  


Additionally, `WP2.2.4 - Features` added the following aspects to the Shiny App:
1. Interactivity of the Shiny App  
2. check boxes of each health board
3. drop down menu for individual hospitals in that health board
4. Tabs
  1). Map of Scotland
  2). Time series graphs
  3). proportional graphs
5. buttons such as:
  * reset
  * select all
6. Statistics on deprivation
7. custom palettes, colour blind friendly
8. forecasting

The topic of our MVP is looking specifically at the __effect Winter__ has on the Health Service in Scotland __within Accident and Emergency (A&E)__, with a focus on the __COVID-19 pandemic's influence.__ 

The dashboard outlines our topic in terms of:
* The geographic spread of the Scottish Health Service
* COVID-19's spread through Scotland
* The activity within A&E departments in Scotland.
